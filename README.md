Project on multivariate gesture recognition - http://gesture.chalearn.org/2013-multi-modal-challenge
I worked on a project involving multivariate Gesture recognition which involved implementation of concepts like multi modal gestures, cosine similarity, dimensionality reduction like Singular Value Decomposition, Principal Component Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Classification Algorithms like Support Vector Machines, K Nearest neighbor and Decision Tree Classification.
